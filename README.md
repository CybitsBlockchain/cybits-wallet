## ðŸ’¿ Installation

You'll find the latest releases on the [releases](https://github.com/CybitsBlockchain/cybits-wallet/releases) tab. Make sure you pick the latest release.

### Auto Updates

Cybits Wallet has built in support for updates. They are not installed automatically, but you as
a user are in control. On each startup, Cybits Wallet will check for a new version. Additionally if
you have been running Cybits Wallet for a long time, you can perform a manual update check in the menu.

When an update is available, there will appear an icon on the menu. Click this icon, to see
update information and perform a download and installation.

### Windows

For Windows, we decided to support both 32-bit and 64-bit installations of Windows.  

Simply download the latest win-x86.exe or win-x64.exe file from the [releases](https://github.com/CybitsBlockchain/cybits-wallet/releases) page and run
the installer. You might need to approve installation of unsigned installer. This will only
be required until we have a signed release available.

### Linux

For Linux, we are still in the process of testing and the Linux wallet will be available shortly.

### Mac

We will only support Mac if there is enough demand from the community.
